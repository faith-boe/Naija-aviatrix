        These <i>group of Nigerian <strong>female pilots</strong> united by their desire to break boundaries and change the norm are not only fun loving lady aviators, they have untited against all odds to bring change, aid, awereness and support to all around them.
        Over the years, these ladies have contributed to raising funds from within themselves for those in need and they did not stop even through the hard times of the corona invasion. </p>
    <p>Their big heart for others, their generosity and intergrity in helping the needy, is what has lead to the growth of their membership to over sixty female pilots.
They do not intend to stop here. A lot have experienced the same tough hardships we face in our economy and therefor e know first hand how to help you navigate your way through whatever lemons life may throw at you.</i></p>
<p><i>They intend on continuing the good work by offering mentorship to boys and girls alike. With partnerships and sponsors, they would be able to continue to do more and reach even farther.</i></p>
